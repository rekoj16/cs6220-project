1) Ground truth: Consolidation; Lung Opacity; Pneumonia; Support Devices. Baseline top-5: Infiltration (0.66), Pneumonia (0.65), Nodule (0.64), Mass (0.63), Consolidation (0.63). Finetuned top-5: Lung Opacity (0.65), Support Devices (0.61), Edema (0.35), Effusion (0.22), Atelectasis (0.11).

2) Baseline behavior: the baseline Grad-CAM shows a tight, high-intensity focus over a focal mid-to-lower pulmonary region adjacent to the cardiac silhouette and diaphragm, which is anatomically consistent with a localized consolidation/infiltrate and supports its high Pneumonia/Infiltration/Consolidation scores.

3) Finetuned behavior: the fine-tuned map is more diffuse and concentrated inferiorly over the cardiophrenic/central lower lung region and over the anterior chest near visible hardware/support devices, matching its high Lung Opacity and Support Devices predictions but less specifically localizing the focal consolidation.

4) Comparison: the baseline better localizes the focal consolidation (better attention focus and relevance to Pneumonia/Consolidation), while the fine-tuned model is better at detecting support devices and global lung opacity but is more diffuse and less precise, causing it to miss the exact focal pathology; this trade-off explains why each model succeeds on different aspects of this case.
