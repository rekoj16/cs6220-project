1) Ground truth: Edema; Lung Opacity. Baseline top-5: Pneumonia (p=0.68), Infiltration (p=0.67), Atelectasis (p=0.64), Consolidation (p=0.64), Nodule (p=0.63). Finetuned top-5: Support Devices (p=0.56), Lung Opacity (p=0.37), Atelectasis (p=0.24), Edema (p=0.19), Fracture (p=0.11).  
2) The baseline heatmap shows very broad, central/left-predominant attention over the cardiac silhouette and middle-to-lower lung fields (diffuse central hotmap extending into the left hemithorax).  
3) The fine-tuned model concentrates lower and more medially around the cardiophrenic/mediastinal region and diaphragmatic recesses with a tighter hotspot, and a smaller locus on the right lateral lung.  
4) These foci are only partially anatomically relevant: edema and diffuse lung opacity often present as bilateral perihilar/interstitial change, but both models emphasize the heart/central lower chest (and the finetuned also flags support-devices), so they are not clearly localizing the diffuse interstitial pattern.  
5) Both models likely struggle because the pathology is subtle and diffuse (low contrast interstitial edema), projection/overlap with the heart and diaphragmatic contours and the presence of external devices can confound attention, producing central or device-related saliency rather than clear bilateral lung-field localization.
