1) Ground truth: Cardiomegaly; Enlarged Cardiomediastinum; Support Devices. Baseline top 5: Cardiomegaly (p=0.70), Effusion (p=0.63), Infiltration (p=0.63), Edema (p=0.62), Mass (p=0.62). Fine‑tuned top 5: Cardiomegaly (p=0.58), Support Devices (p=0.52), Edema (p=0.22), Enlarged Cardiomediastinum (p=0.13), Lung Opacity (p=0.10).  
2) Both heatmaps concentrate on the cardiac silhouette and central mediastinum, with the baseline showing a broader, more diffuse hot region over the whole heart and lower mediastinum and the fine‑tuned model showing a tighter central focus over the cardiac outline (and additional attention near electrode/line sites).  
3) These regions are anatomically appropriate for the ground‑truth labels (cardiomegaly and enlarged cardiomediastinum) and the fine‑tuned model’s attention on peripheral device areas matches the “Support Devices” label.  
4) Overall the fine‑tuned model demonstrates more specific, clinically relevant localization and correctly promotes Support Devices higher, while the baseline’s broader focus likely contributed to false‑positive suggestions like effusion/infiltrate.
