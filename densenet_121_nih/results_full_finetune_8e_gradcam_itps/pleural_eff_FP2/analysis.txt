The baseline model's heatmap reveals a diffuse and non-specific activation across the lungs, indicating a lack of focused reasoning for classification, while the finetuned model emphasizes a prominent area in the middle-central chest, suggesting that it effectively identifies the characteristic fluid accumulation associated with pleural effusion. This targeted attention in the finetuned model likely stems from its ability to recognize the central pleural space, contrasting with the baseline's broader and less informative view that fails to pinpoint relevant anatomical features.
